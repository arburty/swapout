# swapout

A simple script I wrote to delete vims swap files.  I found they pop up a lot and are usually
more annoying than helpful and found myself deleting them often.

## Flags
-f: forces the deletion of all files.

-D: if used first then script goes into debug mode.
    User has to set up a test/.vimswap folder with contents themselves.
